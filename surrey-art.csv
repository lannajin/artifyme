Convergence, Connie Glover and Vallalee Hoffman,"Chuck Bailey Recreation Centre Youth Park, 13458 107A Avenue", Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18056.aspx,2004,"Dancing Tower is a metaphor for the dynamic of dance, and was created to integrate art and architecture. The artwork suggests excitement and passion of individuals and community groups who are using the building to create work and memories for Surrey's cultural legacy."
Lightmodal, Organnelle Design & Urban Visual,Peterson Hill (King George Boulevard at 132 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18145.aspx,2012,"Originally installed at the North Surrey Recreation Centre in Spring 2011, these 50 mosaic projects can now be found outside the Chuck Bailey Recreation Centre. Glover and Hoffman worked with the Whalley community to create a mosaic pathway that reflects the neighbourhood. Located within the gardens on the east site of the building, Convergence reflects on the place people meet as they make their way to work, play, and shopping, and also how the community’s cultural diversity is intermingling and converging. Circular shapes contain images of local history, families, nature, and recreation activities."
Marks, Liz Mago,City Centre Library (10350 University Drive), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18148.aspx,2011,"Lightmodal was inspired by the artists’ desire to create an urban aurora borealis, adding a visual delight to Surrey’s civic environment."
Pebble Mosaics, Glen Andersen,Holland Park (13428 Old Yale Road), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18059.aspx,2008,"Liz Magor’s four sculptural forms titled Marks are installed in a group of three on the third floor and a single piece on the fourth floor of the City Centre Library. These large silicone forms look abstract at first, but seen from above, they resemble punctuation marks. As we move between them, we become part of the narrative of the library: the story of people coming together in a public place to pursue solitary acts of reading, studying, or researching."
"Protecting the Future, Serving the Present", Artform Sculpture Studio,Holland Park (13428 Old Yale Road), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18133.aspx,2009,"A series of pebble mosaic panels are installed on wall inserts and walkways in Holland Park. The artist worked with river rocks, carefully combining colour, texture, size, and form to build complex yet simply stunning designs. These mosaic artworks are based on mandala, wheel, and floral designs and reference cultural and natural motifs. The largest is “Dahlia,” located on the plaza at the King George entrance to the park. All are intended to enhance the park experience and complement nearby steel sculptures by Bruce Voyce."
"Spring Floraform, Summer Floraform, & Seeds of Change", Bruce Voyce,Holland Park (13428 Old Yale Road), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18060.aspx,2008,"This bronze-coloured concrete sculpture was dedicated to the Surrey Firefighters in recognition of their contribution to the City over the past 50 years. It speaks of the spirit and diversity of firefighters, their efforts to safeguard our neighbourhoods and homes, and their charitable work, especially that directly benefitting youth in our community.

The firefighter depicted has been modelled after a serving member of the Surrey Fire Department. Of Korean descent, he represents not only the years of dedicated firemen, but also the cultural and ethnic diversity that is one of the hallmarks of the City of Surrey."
Together, Sophie Nielsen and Rolf Knudsen of Studio Roso,City Hall (13450 104 Ave), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18149.aspx,2014,"Bruce Voyce’s series of large-scale, delicate sculptures, based on flowers, leaves, seeds, and seedpods, are located throughout Holland Park. The artist conceived metal sculptures that refer to edible and medicinal plants with a rich history amongst First Nations cultures as a means to harmonize the urban and natural environments in the park."
Underfoot Yet Overhead (Part 1), Karen Kazme,SkyTrain pillars along University Drive near 105A Avenue, Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18134.aspx,2009,"Surrey's City Hall features an artwork inspired by the theme of democracy. The lead artists took their inspiration for the planned artwork from the behaviour of animals, who work collectively to ensure their survival. Studio Roso said, ""As a way of conveying the theme of ‘democracy,’ we have worked with a conceptual analogy of democracy—a flock of birds."""
Underfoot Yet Overhead (Part 2), Karen Kazme,SkyTrain pillars near Holland Park, Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18143.aspx,2009,"Underfoot Yet Overhead is two different, yet related, series of visual markers installed on SkyTrain pillars in City Centre. In Part 1, viewers will see a series of pierced metal panels with imagery based on the increments of athlete’s movements. Arranged sequentially, like stop-motion animation, the series of twelve different actions celebrate sports activities in Whalley Athletic Park and Holland Park. Artist Karen Kazmer calls each series “a microscopic hunt for meaning.” Their intent is to create a visible presence for what is normally unseen or overlooked."
Were It Not For You, Glen Andersen,Holland Park (13428 Old Yale Road), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18057.aspx,2008,"The venue is Canada's largest non-commercial outdoor urban screen dedicated to presenting digital and interactive art, and can be viewed from SkyTrain, between Gateway and Surrey Central stations."
West Coast Landscape, Gordon Smith,City Centre Library (10350 University Drive), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18146.aspx,2011,"The three-panel “bas-relief” (low relief sculpture) decorates the central fountain wall in Holland Park. The scenes on the panels are executed in a joyous, Art Nouveau style, with a nod to Asian ornament. The triptych’s imagery depicts earth, air, fire, water, and space in dynamic interplay. Symbolic of these are images of a curling fern frond, a hummingbird, the sun, and a fish with overarching waves. This artwork celebrates the life force and complements the other nature-based artworks in the park."
Flood of Memories, Jill Anhol,Surrey Museum (17710 56A Ave), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18154.aspx,2005,"An expansive painting measuring 6’6” x 20’6”, West Coast Landscape was created specifically for the Surrey City Centre Public Library and is located near the entrance on the main floor. It is one of Smith’s largest creations. At first glance, the painting may seem to render a familiar scene. But upon looking closer, this monumental work does more than reproduce a scene from nature."
Flow and Variations of Flow, Robert Stude,Cloverdale Recreation Centre (6188 176 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18158.aspx,2011,"A form reminiscent of a dyke remnant rests on the grassy plane. On one side, deposits of text and images are left on the wall, almost like watermarks from the recession of high water held back by the form in the past. The phrases and images recall multicultural and multigenerational memories from residents related to their past experiences with Surrey’s waterways. On the other side, a vibrant growing garden reveals the fertility of Surrey’s land that has resulted.

The words river, fertile land, saltwater, flooding, dyke, and building are included in six languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, and Punjabi. The garden is composed of calamagnotis, lavender, and bergenia plants. To select the text, Anholt spent time listening to oral history tapes from the Surrey Archives, as well as visited children in a local school."
Kneeling in Remembrance, André Gauthie,Heritage Square (17671 56 Ave), Civic Collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18157.aspx,2006,"Robert Studer’s 30-foot wide wall of shifting colour is located in the main foyer of the new Cloverdale Recreation Centre. Colours emanate from 18 illuminated cylinders behind a diffused glass wall. The eight foot tall cylinders slowly rotate, increasing in speed as patrons in the foyer trigger sensors. The result is a flow of shifting light that responds to the public’s movement. Shapes and colours on the film in the cylinders are derived from computer manipulated aerial images of Cloverdale."
Moments in Time, Paul Slippe,Cloverdale Town Centre (176 St between 56A & 58 Ave), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18156.aspx,2009,"This oversized bronze statue depicts a WWI kneeling soldier, helmet in hand, in remembrance of his fallen comrade. The sculpture was donated to the City through contributions from local school children, Veterans Affairs, Canadian Legion, municipal, and federal sources to complete the top feature of the existing cenotaph. The unveiling of this 650 lb. statue took place during the 2006 Remembrance Day Ceremony. This artwork honours and memorializes our war veterans, the role they played in history, and the sacrifices they made to ensure peace for our lives today."
A Million Summers, Blake William,Surrey Sport and Leisure Complex (16555 Fraser Highway), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18206.aspx,1999,"Three figurative sculptures, carved in granite, have been placed at intervals along Cloverdale’s historic main street. Each 8-foot-high work celebrates an aspect of Cloverdale’s past. The symbolism of these traditional figures is amplified by granite markers engraved with historic facts and inlaid at the base of each sculpture."
Fleetwood Mosaics and Ceramic Mural," Claudine Pommier, Jane Cameron, David Lloyd, Fraser Valley Potters Guild, and Community",Fleetwood Community Centre and Library (15996 84 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18211.aspx,2002,"A Million Summers is an extensive set of murals and two-dimensional artworks displayed in the Surrey Sport and Leisure Complex. The artworks have a strong sense of movement and flight with their images of dragonflies, feathers, and divers falling through space. Ceramic tiles frame the entrance with fragmented images taken from the larger murals at the end of the competition pool. The four large ceramic murals in the pool area show two male and two female divers, symbolizing human ambition and achievement."
From Frozen Ponds, Blake William,Surrey Sport and Leisure Complex (16555 Fraser Highway), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18208.aspx,1999,This mural was an immense undertaking that involved approximately 200 community members. Lloyd worked with Kwantlen University College Ceramics and the Fraser Valley Potters Guild to produce ceramic tiles embossed with images from nature. Pommier and Cameron helped Fleetwood community members create the mosaic panels.
Gnomon, i.e. creative Artworks (Cheryl Hamilton and Mike Vandermeer),Fleetwood Park Gardens (15802 80 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18252.aspx,2013,"Using a similar approach to the artwork in the adjacent Aquatics Centre, From Frozen Ponds is a collage-like mural filling an entire wall of the arena. Focusing on the ice activities of today and days gone by, its central image features a twirling, smiling female hockey player spiralling down a staircase wall."
Lance Corporal Arthur Thomas Fleetwood, Nathan Sco,Fleetwood Community Centre Plaza (84 Avenue and 160 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18253.aspx,2008,"Gnomon, featured in Fleetwood Park’s perennial garden, is inspired by the notion of a sundial marking time. A gnomon is the central part of a sundial that casts a shadow that marks the passage of time. This artwork tells the story of the passage of time in the growth, change, and appearance of Fleetwood’s historic community landmarks."
Multiples of Three, Alberto Replansk,"Fleetwood Booster Pump Station, Meagan Anne MacDougall Park (15385 90 Avenue)", Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18209.aspx,2002,"This life-size bronze sculpture depicts a World War I soldier, seated on a bench with a newspaper on his lap and a duffle bag at his feet. It portrays and honours Lance Corporal Arthur Thomas Fleetwood, who served in France with the 47th Canadian Infantry Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Forces and died there of battle wounds in 1917."
Growth, Maurice van der Beke,Port Kells Community Centre (18918 88 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18255.aspx,1974,Multiples of Three is a distinctive landscape sculpture that acts as a fence fronting the Fleetwood Booster Pump Station. Chunky steel shapes resembling large geometric jigsaw pieces are welded into three groups and aligned asymmetrically along a base of granite slabs.
hangin’ out: biocenesis, i.e. creative Artworks (Cheryl Hamilton and Michael Vandermeer),Fraser Heights Recreation Centre (10588 160 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18368.aspx,2005,"Van Der Beke built Growth to act as a drum that could be struck by people passing by. This relief sculpture at the Port Kells Community Centre is made of pounded sheet copper attached to a hollow frame. The artist embossed the square format with concentric convex ripples and radiating arms. The raised, cross-shaped forms emphasize the frame’s smooth geometry."
The Jungle Project, Duncan Welle,Guildford Library (15105 105 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18367.aspx,2001,"Three glass “characters” resembling living organisms hang from the upper atrium of the Fraser Heights Recreation Centre. The sculptures complement the formal concrete, geometric shape of the building’s architecture through its use of soft rounded shapes while mirroring the surrounding landscape through the use of natural colours drawn from the neighbourhood. The three characters that are ""hangin’ out"" are reminiscent of microorganisms. They are forming a cooperative society in a process called biocenesis that parallels the development of a newly constructed neighbourhood."
Mother Tongue/First Language Learned, Elizabeth Roy,Guildford RCMP (10395 148 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18445.aspx,2004,"The focal point of The Jungle Project is a colourful mural surrounding the puppet stage in the children’s section of the Guildford Library. North Vancouver artist Duncan Weller painted a whimsical background dense with jungle trees, flowers, and foliage, which illustrates the story of the “Love Ant.” The South American-style trees are generalized from Weller’s imagination, together with references from the children’s book department. Two young children, patrons of the library, are pictured reading from a storybook at the base of the mural. Readers can sit on a fanciful throne within the “jungle.”"
Seasons in the Park, John Webber and Epic Production,Highway #1 at 168 Stree, Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18369.aspx,2011,"Mother Tongue/First Language Learned captures the idea that, for each member of the community, there is a need to claim a heritage represented by language. Accompanying this desire is the wish to instill pride and commitment in shared goals and values. In a very real sense, the artwork establishes itself as a beacon for a message that acknowledges the identities and individualities of diversity, linked together and reinforced through the RCMP’s tradition of bridging community strengths."
Splash, Michael Krondl,Guildford Aquatic Centre (15105 105 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18385.aspx,2014,"Seasons in the Park is an illumination for the pedestrian and bicycle overpass that crosses Highway #1 from Tynehead Park to 168th Street. Inspired by the fluid shape of the overpass and the natural landscape in which it is anchored, John Webber created a light-based artwork that draws colours from the leaves, flowers, and water in Tynehead Park. With this design, the whole bridge becomes an illuminated public artwork every night. The lighting effects change in response to different seasons and events."
The Meeting of Mind and Body, Nancy Chew and Jacqueline Metz,Guildford Recreation Centre (15105 105 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18259.aspx,2001,Splash captures the dynamic moment after someone has just dived or jumped into a pool. This digitally manipulated photograph responds to the neighbourhood of Guildford as the source of the Serpentine River and recalls the history of fountains as the social heart of a city. It also references the family-friendly and sporting activities within the Guildford Aquatic Centre.
All Intertwining, Blake William,Waterwise Demonstration Garden (14245 56 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18390.aspx,2002,"This multimedia installation symbolizes the story of Daedalus, the legendary Greek figure who invented wings to fly.  A set of wings suspended above the ground represents Daedalus. As a craftsman, Daedalus would have created many statues of kouroi or young men. From the floor, a bronze statue of a kouros, a youth representing everyman, looks up with longing."
Call of the Siren, Luke Blackstone,Firehall No. 10 (7278 132 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18395.aspx,2007,The WaterWise Demonstration Garden is a project about Xeriscape or landscape water conservation designed to utilize natural rainfall and to encourage the people of Surrey to adopt a view of water as a limited and valuable resource. Vancouver artist Blake Williams worked with park staff to create an engaging series of ceramic-based artwork signs that communicate the philosophy behind the model water conservation project.
Dancing Tower, art.site (Claudia Cuesta and Bill Baker),Newton Cultural Centre (13530 72 Avenue), Civic colleciton,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18412.aspx,2010,"This tribute to firefighters combines architectural features with an interactive sound component. Located in front of Surrey’s Fire Hall #10, this public artwork echoes the historic New York and Chicago-style fire hall architecture employed in the design of the building."
Eagle Calling, Robert Davidson,"Frank Hurt Park, 13828 77 Ave", Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18413.aspx,2014,"Dancing Tower is a metaphor for the dynamic of dance, and was created to integrate art and architecture. The artwork suggests excitement and passion of individuals and community groups who are using the building to create work and memories for Surrey's cultural legacy."
Falling into Formation, Jill Anhol,RCMP Annex (14355 57 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18407.aspx,2010,"Eagle Calling combines the traditional visual iconography of Haida art with a contemporary aesthetic that is elegant in its graceful contours and distinctive in its bold use of colour. Davidson uses red, a traditional primary colour in Northwest Coast art, to symbolize the supernatural and the force of the spirit."
"Nature, Wisdom, and Knowledge", Valeri Sokolovsk,"14245 56 Avenue (old City Hall, under construction)", Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18391.aspx,2005,"Falling into Formation was conceived as a simple yet dynamic and transformative sculpture to engage the imagination of viewers as they pass by. Set in a light-filled two-story stairwell, it consists of a cascade of 768 dichroic glass fins whose colour changes depending on the viewer’s position."
Newton Community Centre Mosaics, Connie Glover and Vallalee Hoffman,"Newton Wave Pool, Arena, Community Centre, & Seniors’ Centre (137 Street & 82 Avenue)", Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18389.aspx,2006,"Nature, Wisdom, and Knowledge is a stone sculpture that sat in the main lobby of the old City Hall.

The Talking Poles," Lorna Boschman, Victoria Moulder, & T’Uy’Tanat-Cease Wy","Serpentine Greenway, north and south of 68 Avenue", Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/7373.aspx,2009,"Artists Connie Glover and Vallalee Hoffman worked closely with members of the Newton community, young and old, to produce glass and ceramic tile mosaics outside each of four recreational facilities in the Newton Town Centre area."
Circulation, Pierre Sasseville and Jean-François Cooke,Grandview Heights Aquatic Centre (16855 24 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18458.aspx,2015,"Talking Poles, installed at sites north and south of 68th Avenue, are two permanent public artworks that represent a series of dialogues between local residents and the artist team. Based on a strategy of community engagement, the Poles reflect diverse cultural values and activities through applied creative expression. The South Pole, activated by nearby physical motion, transmits audio recordings of  words, sounds, poetry and drum beats of people who walk on the Serpentine Greenway while the Poles themselves are wrapped with words and images from many cultural traditions."
Connections, Doug Welch for Eos Lightmedia,"Highway 99, north of 148 Stree", Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18456.aspx,2011,Circulation is a monumental two-part sculpture of deer that references the dual purpose of the Grandview Heights Aquatic Centre: family-oriented recreation and professional competition.
Frogs, Susan Poin,South Surrey Recreation & Arts Centre (2199 148 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18450.aspx,2005,"The light-based artwork for the Pioneer Overpass illuminates the connection between two Surrey neighbourhoods once divided by Highway 99. The highway is itself a connection between Vancouver and the Pacific Border Crossing, between Canada and the United States. As the elegant span of the overpass floats over the highway, it also creates a metaphoric “connection” between earth and sky."
Kwomais: A Place of Vision, Connie Glover and Deborah Putman,Kwomais Point Park (128 Street and 16 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18421.aspx,2012,Susan Point designed and carved a Coast Salish style frog specifically for the South Surrey Recreation & Arts Centre. Panels adorn the central stairway with an interlinking pattern that is repeated in a way that suggests it can go on forever.
Memory Stones, Tina Farmilo,Beecher Street and surrounding community near Crescent Beach, Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18419.aspx,2002,"This large mosaic work illustrating the four elements of earth, air, water, and fire is found at the entrance plaza of the Kwomais Point Park. The ouroboros, a symbol of the eternal circle of life, inspired the circular design and suggests constant transformation. The mosaic creatures refer to guardians or guides welcoming visitors to the park."
Mule Deer, Steve Tyree,Darts Hill Garden (16 Avenue & 170 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18452.aspx,2000,"The innovative Memory Stones at Crescent Beach are a poetic evocation of the history, memories, dreams, and stories of the Crescent Beach community past and present. Artist Tina Farmilo spent time researching the history of the region from local people, especially the elders and historians."
Redwood Forest Mysteries, Derek Rowe,Redwood Park (17900 20 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18420.aspx,2002,"The life-size sculpture of a mule deer is naturalistically sited in a wooded area of Darts Hill Garden. The work, a donation by Mary Mira Robson in memory of her late husband Donald Robson, was created through an unusual fabrication technique using sheets of recycled bronze instead of a mold or the casting of molten metal in a foundry. The realistic representation of a mule deer reflects the artist’s love and appreciation of the natural world and his goal of evoking the spirit inherent in each creature he sculpts."
Ribbon, Ruth Beer and Charlotte Wall,South Surrey Recreation & Arts Centre (14601 20 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18457.aspx,2014,"Redwood Forest Mysteries is a drinking fountain for people and dogs. The sculpture is formed like a large tree stump out of concrete and grooved and stained to look like wood. Embedded in the aesthetically pleasing wood-textured surface are relief sculptures of frogs, foxes, butterflies, and lizards—“wound into the very structure of a stump of life”—as well as portraits of Redwood Park’s original homesteaders, Peter and David Brown. The old stump underscores the interconnectedness of the park’s creatures with its forest."
Semiahmoo Trail Mosaics, Glen Andersen,"16 Avenue at Semiahmoo Mall Sidewalk, 15200 block", Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18454.aspx,2011,"Ribbon celebrates art and athletics, inviting the community to participate in recreational and cultural pursuits. Animating the entrance plaza of the South Surrey Recreation & Arts Centre, the artwork captures the energy and playfulness of the ribbons used in rhythmic gymnastics and the dances of various cultures."
Still Point/From the Centre Outwards, Jacqueline Metz and Nancy Chew,Semiahmoo Library and RCMP District 4 Building (1815 152 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18422.aspx,2004,"Semiahmoo Trail Mosaics were designed to reference the historic Semiahmoo Trail which passes nearby. The art work includes 13 distinct, pebble mosaic tablets illustrating a range of fauna and edible medicinal flora. Footprints, figurative illustrations of animals, and details of vines, shrubs, trees, and insects are portrayed on the “walkway.”"
Terra Incognita, Gwen Curry,Ocean Park Library (12854 17 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18418.aspx,2001,This installation in the lobby of Semiahmoo Library and RCMP District 4 Building describes the accumulation of knowledge and the journey of ideas through a number of symbolic devices. Two primary images form the conceptual framekwork: the mythic “tree of knowledge” and the rippling rings that emanate from a still point on a body of water.
Teamwork, Derek Rowe,Fire Hall #14 (2016 176 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18453.aspx,2011,"Terra Incognita links the Ocean Park Library with its garden, bringing the garden inside and the library outside. The classical interior architecture of the building lends itself well to the large, clear panels inscribed with flora and fauna on either side of curving windows high above the patrons. The panels have an antiquated style much like old-world etchings with their black and white maps, hawk image, and botanical drawings. The title, Terra Incognita or “earth in disguise”, directs the patrons to the uncharted world of books available within."
Tree of Knowledge, Jacqueline Metz and Nancy Chew,Semiahmoo Library (1815 152 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18424.aspx,2004,This low-relief sculpture on Fire Hall #14 is an example of an ancient method of telling stories and commemorating events. Teamwork celebrates the meeting of Surrey’s firefighters and Hall’s Prairie Elementary School students. It reflects the student’s playful interest in fire engines by transforming a three-dimensional sculpture of the engine’s front end into a two-dimensional child’s drawing at the back. The panel was fabricated in glassfibre reinforced concrete in 2010.
Under the Double Eagle and Elder Moon, Leonard Wells and Leslie Well,Traffic roundabout at South Surrey Recreation & Arts Centre (20 Avenue & 144 Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18451.aspx,2009,"The enormous Tree of Knowledge print, installed on the exterior wall of the Semiahmoo Library, was created from the copper panel element of the sculptural piece Stillpoint/From the Centre Outwards. On the copper panel, a historical woodcut image is inscribed. The myriad branches of the monumental tree represent the accumulation and growth of knowledge through time, and underscore the relationship of new knowledge to prior knowledge."
Building Bridges," Vallalee Hoffman, Claire Cilliers with Bridgeview Community Association and the Surrey Environmental Education Centre",Bridgeview Community Hall (11475 126A Street), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18495.aspx,2004,"Under the Double Eagle and Elder Moon links Semiahmoo Coast Salish culture with other First Nations and Surrey communities. The sculptures, which are two large, upright cedar disks mounted back to back, are installed on the traffic roundabout at the South Surrey Recreation & Arts Centre, near the Semiahmoo First Nation community. Their circular design alludes to traditional Coast Salish spindle whorls and speaks to a history of art-making distinctive to the region."
Continuum: From Seed to Shelter, Eric Robertson,"Green Timbers Greenway, adjacent to Fraser Hwy, southeast of 96 Avenue", Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18499.aspx,2009,"Hoffman and Cilliers worked with the Bridgeview community to create a large, detailed mosaic walkway with seats and a nearby painted mural. In developing a theme for the project, the creative team considered Bridgeview’s history as one of Surrey’s oldest communities and its connection to the Fraser River."
Four Elements, Kip Jones & Jennifer Macklem,Firehall No. 2 (13079 104 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18488.aspx,1999,"This artwork consists of six large-scale, inter-related sculptures mounted atop 12-foot fluted cedar poles. Their installation follows the contour of the walking trail in the Green Timbers Greenway, adjacent to the Fraser Highway. The sculptures, which are cast in glass-fibre-reinforced concrete, range between two and four feet in height. The work honours the history and ecology of the Green Timbers Urban Forest and pays homage to the western cedar."
Lingua Aqua," Melanie Cassidy, Michael Filimowicz, Brady Marks, and Philippe Pasquie",Bear Creek Park Gardens (13750 88 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18500.aspx,2009,"This work consists of a kinetic sculpture and three copper panels. The sculpture is a freestanding helix with three asymmetrical tops moving gently in the breeze. The spinners are shaped in turn like a pinwheel, a circle, and an open umbrella. They attract visitors closer to a set of aluminum beads mysteriously inscribed with letters and symbols from Hindi, Greek, Cyrillic, Japanese, Arabic and Roman alphabets."
Mandala After a Prayer Wheel, Maurice Van der Beke,Surrey Arts Centre (13750 88 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18459.aspx,1974 (re-installed 2002),"Lingua Aqua alludes to the idea of “lingua franca,” a hybrid language originally developed to enable people of different mother tongues to communicate. Built in the form of a small pavilion or shelter, Lingua Aqua combines sculptural, architectural, graphic, audio, and water elements to create an immersive sonic environment. This “bath of sounds” is the place in which language is first heard and sounds from the outside environment first experienced."
On the Wind, Blake William,Surrey Arts Centre (13750 88 Avenue), Public,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18486.aspx,2006,"Inspired by prayer wheels used by Tibetan Buddhist monks and laypersons as a way to distribute blessings and spread positive wishes, this large kinetic sculpture enlarges the traditional small prayer wheel to a more public scale. The wheel, which has no beginning and no end, is believed to attract Perfection and Peace, key concepts of the Buddhist faith."
Out of Thin Air, Alan Storey,Surrey Arts Centre (13750 88 Avenue), Civic collection,http://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/18489.aspx,2004,"On the Wind is a series of 22 unique kinetic banners that move in the wind. Hanging in the parking lot, they mark the entrance to the Surrey Arts Centre."
Poetry Rock, Rev.
